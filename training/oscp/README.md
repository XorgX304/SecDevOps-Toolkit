# Overview:

 There are many OSCP guides which have a variety of technical info.  Yet, 
 only few solutions which help an individual construct a full penTest 
 environment, targets & all, in the AWS.  

 This ultimate goal is to automate downloading the ova/vmdk into S3, 
 create ami's in your account, store the info into env for terraform,
 automate the setup/destruction via simple git commit msg trigger. 

 There are a bunch of CTF target scripts & docker assets documented in 
 various readmes in this project which need to be setup/documented.  
 I believe they add great value to this project yet are not a top 
 priority. 

Given this is now the XXth iteration 
of this Cyber-Cloud project, it is very likely it will continue to 
evolve.
