# Overview
This is simply an AWS-based solution for a PenTester.  The goal is to 
provide a cloud penTesting environment with within minutes.

Todo that, I've created 8 AMI's in us-east-1 which are currently private.

I've implemented aws-nuke and successfully purged all undesired resources from multiple regions.

This project will evolve into the SecDevOPs-Cuse toolkit... stay tuned.
