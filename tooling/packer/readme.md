# overview  
packer has been used in a few different scenarios. 
metasploitable3 has packer templates
packer-windows also has packer templates

I've leveraged packer to build ova's for upload into amazon ami's as I 
yet I'm lacking some window's clients.

The goal here is to leverage the 2 projects to make a bunch of vuln
windows machines.
