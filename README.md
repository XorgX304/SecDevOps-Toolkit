# Why would you want to use me?

As a Cloud Architect, I recognize the enormous business value that rapid 
prototying & extreme programming principles provide to a global IT 
workforce. 

The tools outlined below enable Developers, DevOps Engineers, &
Designers the ability to define, isolate, & automate dependencies to 
create a reproducible & automated application / infrastructure 
environment.  

The goal of this toolbox is to provide any individual with a framework
to get started implementing the use of these tools for use-cases which
benefit them.

## Chocolately  
Described as the the "apt-get for windows".  There are currently 4,863 
software packages available for install.  Using chocolately allows us to
leverage a large repository of programs.  

* URL: https://chocolatey.org/packages



### Execution:
It is executed through the windows shell thru a 'terraform apply' step. 
This has not yet been introduced into the vagrantfile & tested but it is
reasonably possible to do so.
 

chocolately is installed and automatically available for any combination of software installs
cli use: ```terraform apply -target=aws_instance.win2016_base -var 'software=winrar googlechrome notepadplusplus flashplayerplugin jre8'```
variables.mf - this is a file where you can set the variables & associated values


challenges - does the software that gets installed = valid testing condition

## Puppet


# Data Organization

## Vagrant - yaml

vagrant has 2 primary yaml files.  One is the aws.yaml file which has the following format & holds the credentials.

## Terraform - hcl/json
